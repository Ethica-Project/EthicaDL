# EthicaDL

EthicaDL lets you quickly and safely download videos or your own content with permission. Choose the quality you need (1080p, 720p, audio-only) via a clean, simple UI from a share or upload URL. We follow the rules and respect rights: only download content you own or have explicit permission to use.

## About

EthicaDL is a lightweight web service for downloading video content you have rights to. Using a clean interface, it prompts users to paste a URL and select resolution. Server-side, yt-dlp handles the download. We emphasize ethics: only content with permission should be downloaded.
